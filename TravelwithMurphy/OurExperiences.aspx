         <img src="images/thumb_point_reyes.jpg" alt="Point Reyes National Lake Shore California"/>
		<p>Point Reyes was the highlight of our trip to San Francisco. We did not have any expectations going there and were blown away by the views! 
		</p></article>
	
		<article><h3>Glacier National Park</h3>
		<img src="images/thumb_glacier.jpg" class="photo" alt="glacier_national_park">
		<p>This is my favorite national park. It's impossible to choose just one photo. I get asked what camera I used for this photo and people are surprised when I answer 
		the iPhone 7. We did a Half Marathon going into the park. Probably should have trained more for it instead of watching Netflix and eating pizza.</p></article>
			
		<article><h3>Local Zoos</h3>

		<p class="oeText">My wife and I love watching nature documentaries so we always make time to visit the local zoos. This photo was taken in the St. Louis zoo. I would also recommend the Omaha zoo,
		it almost takes the whole day to see everything!</p></article>
		
		<article><h3>Touring Local Breweries</h3>

		<p class="oeText">Being from the midwest we have to try out the local flavors. It is a nice way to unwind after a long hike. I would recommend the Brewing Projekt in Eau Claire!</p></article>
